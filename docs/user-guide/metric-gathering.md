# Metric Gathering

The metric gathering stage is the first stage of the autoscaler. This stage is responsible for
gathering all information that the scaling decision will be based on. The autoscaler base program
passes in information based on the `runMode`, and the metric program is expected to output the metrics 
it gathers and to report any errors.

# Run modes

The `runMode` specifies how often the metric gathering is run, and the information supplied to the 
metric gatherer. How the information is provided depends on the method used, e.g. if it is a shell
command method the information will be provided through standard in and piped to the script, see
the [methods section for more information](../methods).

## per-pod
This mode runs the metric gatherer against every pod in the resource being managed.  
Each individual pod's information is passed into the metric gatherer each time it is run against 
each pod in JSON. An example of the pod JSON passed to the metric gatherer:
```json
{
    "apiVersion": "v1",
    "kind": "Pod",
    "metadata": {
        "creationTimestamp": "2019-11-14T01:52:21Z",
        "generateName": "flask-metric-869879868f-",
        "labels": {
            "app": "flask-metric",
            "pod-template-hash": "869879868f"
        }, 
        "name": "flask-metric-869879868f-2cslm",
        "namespace": "default",
        "ownerReferences": [
            {
                "apiVersion": "apps/v1",
                "blockOwnerDeletion": true,
                "controller": true,
                "kind": "ReplicaSet",
                "name": "flask-metric-869879868f",
                "uid": "2b028109-4793-4409-bd9c-a44d74da2fbc"
            }
        ],
        "resourceVersion": "208999",
        "selfLink": "/api/v1/namespaces/default/pods/flask-metric-869879868f-2cslm",
        "uid": "5a0ab9a6-dccc-497d-8d41-11f0408740b3"
    },
    ...
}
```

## per-resource
This mode runs the metric gatherer only once against the resource being managed.  
The resource information is passed into the metric gatherer in JSON, for example if managing a
deployment the deployment information will be passed in. 
An example of deployment JSON passed to the metric gatherer:
```json
{
  "resource": {
    "kind": "Deployment",
    "apiVersion": "apps/v1",
    "metadata": {
      "name": "hello-kubernetes",
      "namespace": "default",
      "labels": {
        "numPods": "3"
      },
    },
    ...
  },
  "runType": "scaler"
}
```

# Information output by the metric gatherer

The metric gatherer should gather/calculate the metrics it needs, and simply needs to return these 
metrics back to the autoscaler, if an error occurs the metric gatherer should report this error, 
alongside surfacing any error information.  
How the metric gatherer returns information/errors is dependent on the method used for the metric 
gatherer, for example if it is a shell command method, information is returned by writing to 
standard out, and an error is signified by a non-zero exit code - with further error information 
stored to standard error and standard out, see the [methods section for more information](../methods).
