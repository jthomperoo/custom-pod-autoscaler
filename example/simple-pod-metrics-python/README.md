# Python Simple Pod Metrics Example
This example shows how to make a Custom Pod Autoscaler (CPA) using Python.  
The example extends the Python CPA base image (custompodautoscaler/python) and sets up an environment to allow python scripts to be used to determine metrics and evaluate how to scale.  
The code is verbosely commented and designed to be read and understood for building your own CPAs.

## Overview
This example contains a docker image of the example Python Custom Pod Autoscaler, alongside using the `flask-metric` sample application ([../flask-metric/README.md](../flask-metric/README.md)) as a target to scale up and down.

### Example Custom Pod Autoscaler

The CPA will try to ensure that there is always atleast `1` available across the resource and each app in the resource.  
The CPA will also ensure there are no more than `5` available across the resource.  
The CPA exposes two endpoints:
* `GET /api/v1/metrics`
    * Displays all gathered metric values from every app instance in the resource.
    * Aliased with `metrics` in the example Dockerfile.
* `GET /api/v1/evaluation`
    * Displays the evaluation decision made on how to scale, reporting the `targetReplicas` - how many replicas the resource should have.
    * Aliased with `evaluation` in the example Dockerfile.

## Usage
Trying out this example requires a kubernetes cluster to try it out on, this guide will assume you are using Minikube.  

### Enable CPAs
Using this CPA requires CPAs to be enabled on your kubernetes cluster, [follow this guide to set up CPAs on your cluster](https://github.com/jthomperoo/custom-pod-autoscaler-operator#installation).  

### Switch to target the Minikube registry
Target the Minikube registry for building the image:  
`eval $(minikube docker-env)`

### Deploy an app for the CPA to manage
You need to deploy an app for the CPA to manage:  
* Build the example app image.  
`docker build -t flask-metric ../flask-metric`  
* Deploy the app using a deployment.  
`kubectl apply -f ../flask-metric/deployment.yaml`  
Now you have an app running to manage scaling for.

### Build CPA image
Once CPAs have been enabled on your cluster, you need to build this example, run these commands to build the example:  
* Build the example image.  
`docker build -t simple-pod-metrics-python .`  
* Deploy the CPA using the image just built.  
`kubectl apply -f cpa.yaml`  
Now the CPA should be running on your cluster, managing the app we previously deployed.

## Testing the CPA
* List pods.  
`kubectl get pods -l app=flask-metric`  
* Exec into a pod.  
`kubectl exec -it POD_NAME bash`  
* Get value.  
`metric`  
* Increment value.  
`increment`  
* Decrement value.  
`decrement`
